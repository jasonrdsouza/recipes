title: "Flaneur"
template: recipe.mustache
time: "2 minutes"
makes: "1"
ingredients:
  - 2 parts Bulliet Rye Whiskey
  - 1 part Cynar
  - 1 part Aperol
  - Citrus twist **(orange or lemon, optional)**
steps:
  - Combine ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until cold
  - Strain into rocks glass
  - Garnish with citrus twist if desired
notes:
  - This is a variation on the classic Boulevardier recipe **(which I independently invented, but later found out is basically a "Cynara")**, which calls for campari and sweet vermouth. I find the Aperol **(campari's sweeter cousin)** and Cynar **(a vegetal, artichoke flavored vermouth cousin)** pair better with the spicy herbal mintyness of the Bulliet Rye. Your mileage may vary depending on the whiskey you use.
  - The Boulevardier more generally is itself a variation on the even more classic Negroni cocktail, which uses Gin as the base spirit instead of whiskey.
basedon:
  - Personal negroni experimentation
  - "[Cynara recipe from the Amaro book by Brad Thomas Parsons](https://btparsons.com/amaro/)"
