title: "Margarita"
template: recipe.mustache
time: "2 minutes"
makes: "1 servings"
ingredients:
  - Tequila
  - Cointreau **(or alternative triple sec)**
  - Limes
  - Salt **(optional)**
steps:
  - In a shaker, add equal parts lime juice and cointreau
  - Add 2-2.5 parts tequila
  - Add ice and shake until cold
  - Serve with salt rim if desired
notes:
  - Since I'm squeezing fresh lime juice, I tend to base the rest of the ingredient proportions on how much juice I get from the lime
  - "[Espolon](https://espolontequila.com/) is a widely available tequila which I used for a long time, and while you could do worse, it's also relatively easy to do better. I particularly like [Fortaleza](https://tequilafortaleza.com/), which is a bit pricier, but much more flavorful."
  - It's easy to create variations on the standard margarita by substituting alternative liqueurs for the triple sec. I enjoy the "italian margarita", which subs amaretto.
  - To add more flavor complexity and depth to your margarita, try putting a bit of citrus peel into the cocktail shaker before shaking the ingredients. This technique is called the "regal shake", and works particularly well for margaritas with a grapefruit peel.
