title: "Smoothie"
template: recipe.mustache
time: "3 minutes"
makes: "1 serving"
ingredients:
  - 1 cup frozen blueberries
  - 1 banana
  - 1 dollop peanut butter
  - 1 scoop protein powder **(chocolate or vanilla flavor)**
  - 2 tablespoon flax seed
  - 2 tablespoon wheat germ
  - 1 tablespoon chia seeds
  - 2 teaspoons tumeric
  - 2 teaspoons cinnamon
  - 1 cup whole milk
steps:
  - Blend everything together
  - Modulate milk amount to reach desired consistency
notes:
  - Great for post-workout
  - "My protein powder of choice is [Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey](https://www.optimumnutrition.com/en-us/product/gold-standard-100-whey)"
  - Other frozen berries/ fruit work in a pinch, but it's hard to beat the nutritiousness and deliciousness of frozen blueberries (especially wild-caught ones)
  - If trying to cut calories, leave the peanut butter out
  - I add the tumeric and cinnamon more for their health benefits than for taste, and the tumeric in particular adds a flavor which some may find unappealing, so leave them out if desired.
basedon:
  - Years of post-workout iteration
