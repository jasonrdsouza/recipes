title: "The Eulogy"
template: recipe.mustache
time: "2 minutes"
makes: "1 servings"
ingredients:
  - 0.75oz Batavia Arrack
  - 0.75oz lime juice
  - 0.75oz Strega
  - 0.75oz Velvet Falernum
steps:
  - Add all ingredients to a shaker and shake with ice until cold
  - Double strain into a nick & nora glass and serve
notes:
  - Apparently this cocktail was invented at the Anvil bar in Houston, TX. I was recently in Houston for a wedding, and went to Anvil. Victor, our bartender, made me a variant with Sotol instead of Batavia Arrack (working name "Elogio") that was very good.
  - It seems like this template would work well with funky rums in general.
