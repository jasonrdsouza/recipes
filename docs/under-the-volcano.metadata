The flavors meld together in a way that really make the sum greater than its parts.","The original recipe calls for Del Maguey Chichicapa Mezcal, but I've often made it with the more affordable Fidencio Clasico with good results.","Unlike the Mezcal, substituting out the sherry or amaro for alternative expressions results in an inferior cocktail without the synergy of the original, and so isn't recommended."],"basedon":["[The Hawthorne's Under the Volcano](http://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2013/09/under-volcano.html)"],"CORK_url":"under-the-volcano.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0}
