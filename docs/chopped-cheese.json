It ups the umami and adds a welcome savory character.","The hatch peppers and italian hots aren't typically used in a chopped cheese, but I think they add a great flavor profile.","Steaming in the aluminum foil softens the toasted bread a bit, and ensures that the sandwich contents bind together better, making them less likely to fall out when you take a bite."],"basedon":["[Kenji Lopez's Harlem Chopped Cheese Recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NdpVlfnwB4)"],"CORK_url":"chopped-cheese.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0,"content":"\n"}
