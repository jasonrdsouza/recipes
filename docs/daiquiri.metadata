It's certainly true that there are many overly sweet, frozen. or otherwise dreadful variations, but just like scrambled eggs, if you combine quality ingredients with proper technique, the result is really something remarkable.","Given the limited ingredients, it's crucial that you're using a good rum with a flavor profile you enjoy, and freshly squeezed lime juice","Two of my favorite rums to use in daiquiris are Bully Boy White Rum and Plantation Pineapple Rum. The Bully Boy White Rum **(not to be confused with Bully Boy's other options)** has a delicious caramel-like character which rounds out well in the cocktail, and the Plantation Pineapple Rum performs similarly, but with a pineapple backbone instead.","For an interesting twist, try substituting Rhum Agricole for regular rum. I particularly like Rhum J.M white rum, which has a much more funky vegetal, and caribbean fruit undertone than regular rum."],"basedon":["Ashley's **(Juniper)** Daiquiri","[Stirred Blog's Perfect Daiquiri](https://stirredblog.com/2017/02/25/the-perfect-daiquiri/)","[Stirred Blog's Rhum J.M.
