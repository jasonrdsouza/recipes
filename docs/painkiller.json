It also works relatively well with cheap rum that you wouldn't sip neat since the other ingredients mask off flavors.","Also, unlike the [original recipe](https://pussersrum.com/blogs/cocktails/pussers-painkiller), I up the ratio of rum to other ingredients because I prefer to be able to taste the flavor of the liquor.","Typically a painkiller is served over ice, but I personally enjoy it \"up\" as long as it has been shaken enough to properly chill and dilute it. If having it up, it's best to double strain to avoid little slivers of ice ruining the mouthfeel."],"basedon":["[Pusser's Painkiller](https://pussersrum.com/blogs/cocktails/pussers-painkiller)","[Anders' \"Not a Painkiller\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYfHK3goJLk)"],"CORK_url":"painkiller.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0,"content":"\n"}
