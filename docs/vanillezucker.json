{"title":"Vanillezucker","template":"recipe.mustache","time":"2 minutes","makes":"~50 servings","ingredients":["1 vanilla bean","Granulated sugar"],"steps":["Fill a mason jar half way full with granulated **(white)** sugar","Split 1 vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the inner seeds","Add scraped seeds to the jar of sugar, stirring to combine","Fill the mason jar the rest of the way up with sugar","Insert the scraped vanilla bean husks into the jar **(the sugar will pull out more flavor from the husks)**","Close the jar and shake to combine everything/ coat the vanilla bean husks with sugar","Wait overnight or a few days for optimal flavor, shaking occasionally to ensure even extraction"],"notes":["This goes great in coffee... I have phased out my use of coffee creamer, instead preferring to use this vanillezucker with some half and half.","The mason jar can be refilled once or twice with sugar, with each refill resulting in less overt vanilla flavor. I tend to refill once the sugar is around halfway gone, but then create a new batch once it is finished since I enjoy the stronger vanilla flavor.","This recipe works almost as well with just the husks, which is handy if you need the inner vanilla seeds for a different recipe that would otherwise waste the husk."],"basedon":["[Epicurious Vanilla Sugar](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/vanilla-sugar-vanillezucker)"],"CORK_url":"vanillezucker.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0,"content":"\n"}
