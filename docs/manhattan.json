I like Luxardo, and find that adding a few drops of the cherry syrup helps accentuate the rest of the flavors in the glass.","Unlike most cocktails, I prefer the taste of this one as it warms, finding that it gets richer and more decadent tasting towards the end **(likely helped along by the cherry at the bottom)**."],"basedon":["[Classic Manhattan Recipe](https://www.liquor.com/recipes/manhattan-2/)"],"CORK_url":"manhattan.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0,"content":"\n"}
