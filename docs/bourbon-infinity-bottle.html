      <h2>steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li id="step">Every time you buy a new bourbon, add a small amount to your infinity bottle</li>
        <li id="step">After adding to the infinity bottle, wait at least 12 hours before sampling the result **(to allow the flavors to marry)**</li>
        <li id="step">When you start to run out of space, drink down the existing juice to make room for more. This will alter the ratios of the constituent bourbon, but in traditional [Solera](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Solera) style, a fraction of each will remain</li>
        <li id="step">Over time the infinity bottle will begin to take on its own character, which you can guide by the inclusion of bourbons with specific flavor profiles</li>

      <h2>notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id="note">**2017-06-12** Decided to start my own Bourbon infinity bottle. Bourbons I particularly like&#x2F; think are a good value are denoted with an asterisk</li>
        <li id="note">**2018-11-17** Tasted before adding the 1792, and it has a Bulliet backbone, but with notes of the Hudson Baby shining through. Most of the others are not noticeable, with maybe a hint of Old Forester</li>
        <li id="note">**2020-09-21** After quite some time away from bourbon, I have recently started drinking it as my nightcap, and as such have gone through a few new bottles. With the addition of the Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, the infinity bottle (750ml) is full. The Woodford comes through when I taste it, with some of the spice and heat of the Old Ezra, but it&#x27;s getting pretty hard to tease out the constituent bourbons.</li>
        <li id="note">**2020-10-07** The Old Forester 1920 is coming through as the dominant note, but in a subdued sort of way that makes it more palatable than drinking it straight (likely because the overall mixture is lower proof than the 1920 by itself. Not sure if it&#x27;s because that&#x27;s what I recently added (although I did wait well over the recommended 12 hours before sampling it), and I didn&#x27;t mix things around well enough, or just because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been drinking lately, and so my palate is acclimated to the flavor profile. Either way, the infinity bottle flavors continue to impress.</li>
        <li id="note">**2020-11-22** With the addition of the Balcones Baby Blue and Michters American whiskey, this infinity bottle is technically no longer a bourbon (an eagle eye may notice Jack Daniels earlier on, but while they don&#x27;t call it a bourbon, Jack meets all the requirements). I decided to branch out to these two whiskeys because I felt the bottle needed a little rounding out, and have really been enjoying the subtle complexity of both Balcones and Michters. Additionally, both are made in the &#x27;bourbon style&#x27;, with the Balcones being 100% blue corn, and the Michters American whiskey being the Michters bourbon mash bill, just aged in used oak instead of new, so overall the bourbon spirit remains.</li>
        <li id="note">**2021-02-22** With the addition of a few wheated bourbons, the infinity bottle flavors have rounded out and gotten noticeably richer. The bottle was close to full, so I&#x27;ve been drinking it down and comparing it to the recent (lesser known, craft) bourbons I&#x27;ve been buying, and I find it to consistently beat them on flavor, mouthfeel, and finish.</li>
        <li id="note">**2021-04-16** I just added Balcones Texas Rye, which in typical Balcones style has a very unique flavor profile. They use a variety of less common ryes, which leads to a subtle spicy chocolate flavor to round out the more traditional rye spice notes, with a classic Balcones finish. Of course, this isn&#x27;t technically a bourbon, but given that I&#x27;ve previously added a few straight corn whiskeys, I figured adding some straight rye would balance things out nicely. More importantly, I&#x27;m really enjoying the flavor profile of this one, so interested to see how it affects the overall infinity bottle taste.</li>
        <li id="note">**2021-05-19** Currently, the predominant flavors I&#x27;m getting are a mixture of the Makers Mark Cask Strength and the Balcones Texas Rye, which pair great together! There&#x27;s a residual depth of flavor that I&#x27;m attributing to the long tail of other bourbons, and a faint woody smoke note presumably from the Longbranch. I&#x27;m tempted to try blending some of the remaining Makers and Balcones Rye together instead of drinking them on their own because of how much I&#x27;m enjoying their complimentary flavors.</li>
