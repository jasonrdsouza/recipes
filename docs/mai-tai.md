title: "Mai Tai"
template: recipe.mustache
time: "2 minutes"
makes: "1 servings"
ingredients:
  - 2oz Rum **(preferably an aged, dark rum)**
  - 0.5oz Orgeat
  - 0.5oz Simple Syrup
  - 0.5oz Dry Curacao
  - 0.75oz fresh lime juice
  - Mint **(for garnish)**
steps:
  - Add lime juice, orgeat, dry curacao, simple syrup, and rum to shaker
  - Add crushed ice to the shaker (about 12oz), and shake until cold
  - Pour contents of shaker **(ice and all)** directly into a glass
  - Garnish with an overturned spent lime shell and mint sprig, and serve
notes:
  - The overturned lime shell and mint sprig garnish is meant to look like a small tropical island and palm tree, and provides some welcome aromatics. Trader Vic, famed inventor of this cocktail, didn't like the typical little umbrella garnish, and never used it.
  - Historically there is no rum "float", but lots of people **(including me)** like it as a flavor enhancer. I'll typically use a flavor packed rum like Diplomatico Reserva for it.
  - As with all cocktails, using fresh lime juice is essential
  - I've tried subbing in Rhum Agricole as the base spirit, but haven't enjoyed the resulting drink as much as with regular dark rum.
  - I tend to over-shake **(and thus over-dilute)** cocktails, but with this one, I've found that I wasn't diluting it enough, leading to it tasting too sharp initially, and then getting better as I let it sit and the ice melted. Unlike drinks that you shake/ stir and then strain, I think it is relatively difficult to over-dilute a cocktail like this which ends up getting served on the same ice it was mixed with.
  - While I gave exact measurements above, the important thing with all cocktails is the ratio, so in reality I usually juice a lime, and then adjust the rest of the proportions based on how much lime juice I'm working with.
  - There are a variety of Curacaos available, but by far the best one I've had so far is the Pierre Ferrand Dry Curacao, so I usually use that in my Mai Tais. In a pinch, Cointreau works as well.
  - My preferred simple syrup for a Mai Tai is to use 2 parts dark brown sugar to 1 part water. This is technically considered "double strength" simple syrup, and it adds a bit more viscosity **(and obviously a little more sweetness)** to the cocktail.
