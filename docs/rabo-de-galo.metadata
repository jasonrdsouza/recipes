{"title":"Rabo de Galo","template":"recipe.mustache","time":"2 minutes","makes":"1 servings","ingredients":["1.5oz Cachaca","1oz Sweet vermouth **(Cinzano)**","0.5oz Cynar","Lime peel"],"steps":["Combine cachaca, cocchi, and cynar in a mixing glass and stir over ice until cold.","Strain into a rocks glass over a large cube of ice.","Express the lime peel over the top, and drop it in as a garnish."],"notes":["I came across this drink on a [recent trip to Brazil](https://www.partyinparaty-juliaandadam.com/), and really enjoyed its complexity compared to the typical caipirinha variants that are the cocktail du jour over there (not that I have anything against Caipirinhas... they're probably my favorite tropical style drink, but there's only so many one can drink before you crave some variety).","Apparently this drink was created by Cinzano after they opened a factory in Sao Paulo and wanted to sell more vermouth to the locals. They introduced this foreign concept of mixing 2 alcoholic bases as a \"cocktail\", which in Portuguese translates as \"galo\" -> rooster/ cock, and \"rabo\" -> tail.","Drinkers would order the rabo de gallo, which initially was equal parts cachaca and cinzano in a shot glass, pour a little out \"for the saints\", and then shoot the rest.","Over time various bartenders made their own variant of the cocktail, with various mixtures and types of sweet vermouth.","Today, the standard formula seems to be to use a combination of some sweet vermouth and cynar. Most recipes lean towards a modern template of a higher Cachaca to vermouth ratio, but I prefer the original template of 1:1 in my own rendition."],"basedon":["[Anders - Rabo de Gallo](https://youtu.be/YFqEvNdPrX8)","[Rabo de Gallo](https://punchdrink.com/articles/rabo-de-gala-cachaca-cocktail-recipe-brazil/)"],"CORK_url":"rabo-de-galo.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0}
