Substituting the classic gin for bourbon results in a Boulevardier, and with prosecco yields a Negroni Sbagliato. I was interested in a smokier version, but didn't find a scotch that would go. Mezcal, on the other hand, **(I used Del Maguey Chichicapa)** has a nice fruity, earthiness accompanying its smoke which I find pairs well with the rest of the negroni components."],"basedon":["My experimentation on Negroni variations, loosely based on a [TiNegroni](https://www.saveur.com/tiny-negroni-cocktail-recipe/)"],"CORK_url":"narcos-negroni.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0,"content":"\n"}
