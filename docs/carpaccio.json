As long as you don't go too long, it has a minimal effect of the flavor of the dish","I don't have amounts for most of the ingredients because this is a dish that goes mostly by personal preference. I tend to add enough olive oil to lightly coat the beef, lemon juice to balance out the fattiness, and then the rest to taste.","For the toasted bread, I prefer a softer toast, ideally griddled with olive oil or butter. Challah and croissants also work well."],"basedon":["[Jacques Pepin Beef Carpaccio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbj6aoYU_ro)","[Serious Eats Leftover Steak Carpaccio Salad](https://www.seriouseats.com/scrapcook-leftover-steak-carpaccio-salad)"],"CORK_url":"carpaccio.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0,"content":"\n"}
