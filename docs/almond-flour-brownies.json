{"title":"Almond Flour Brownies","template":"recipe.mustache","time":"60 minutes","makes":"12 servings","ingredients":["1.75 cups sugar","5 tablespoons butter","0.5 teaspoon salt","1 teaspoon vanilla extract","0.75 cup cocoa powder **(Dutch process)**","3 large eggs","1.5 cups almond flour","1 teaspoon baking powder"],"steps":["Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease an 8\" square pan or 9\" round pan **(either should be at least 2\" deep)**","Place the sugar, butter, and salt in a microwave-safe bowl or saucepan. Heat over medium heat, stirring with a heatproof spatula until the butter melts and the mixture lightens in color. **(This step helps melt the sugar, which will help give the brownies a shiny crust.)**","If you've heated the sugar and butter in a saucepan, transfer the mixture to a bowl; otherwise, just leave the hot ingredients right in their microwave-safe bowl. Let the mixture cool for a couple of minutes.","Blend in the vanilla and cocoa, then add the eggs and mix until shiny.","Blend in the flour and baking powder.","Pour the batter into the prepared pan, spreading it to the edges.","Bake the brownies for 33 to 38 minutes, until the top is set; and a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean or nearly so, with perhaps a few wet crumbs, or a tiny touch of chocolate at the tip of the tester.","Remove the brownies from the oven and cool them for about 15 minutes before cutting. Once the brownies are cool, cover them tightly with plastic."],"notes":["Store at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage."],"basedon":["King Arthur Recipe"],"CORK_url":"almond-flour-brownies.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0,"content":"\n"}
