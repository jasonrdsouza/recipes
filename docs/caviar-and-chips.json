Kettle cooked chips provide a good crunch, and structural integrity to ensure a successful dip. Cape cod original chips are my go to.","Red onion works well as a substitute to shallot","The key is not to overwhelm the taste of the caviar with the shallot and lemon. Leaving those ingredients out entirely is also fine, and results in a more focused expression of the caviar."],"basedon":["Personal experimentation"],"CORK_url":"caviar-and-chips.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0,"content":"\n"}
