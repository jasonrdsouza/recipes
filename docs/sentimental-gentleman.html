      <h2>notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id="note">This is a great &quot;rusty nail&quot; variation, and the walnut flavor from the liquor complements a range of underlying whiskey notes, which makes it amenable to most brown spirits.</li>
        <li id="note">Different walnut liquors will likely affect the overall flavor of the drink, and Nux Alpina seems to be the one that bartenders like the best, but I couldn&#x27;t find it around me, so settled for a Bulgarian one called Nero, which was all I could find.</li>
        <li id="note">I first tried this with Monkey Shoulder, which is the blended scotch that [Anders](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;@AndersErickson) uses in his video, and found it quite good. I later tried it with Johnnie Walker Double Black which I liked even better, and is probably my favorite rendition so far.</li>
        <li id="note">I tried using a few different bourbons **(of various proof intensities)**, but didn&#x27;t find any that were as tasty in this cocktail as the blended scotch. Similarly, I tried a rum variant **(using Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva)**, which I enjoyed, but still was not as good as the blended scotch versions.</li>
        <li id="note">Rye whiskey is a mixed bag, with fruiter, lighter ryes working well, but spicy ones seeming to clash too much with the rest of the flavors in the drink.</li>
        <li id="note">Lastly, I tried with a few single malts, and the less peaty ones worked quite well. The best versions used richer **(older)** bodied scotch, but I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to &quot;waste&quot; single malt like this, and so will likely stick to blended scotch in the future.</li>
      </ul>
