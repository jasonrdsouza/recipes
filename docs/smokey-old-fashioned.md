title: "Smokey Old Fashioned"
template: recipe.mustache
time: "2 minutes"
makes: "1 cocktail"
ingredients:
  - 1 oz overproofed bourbon
  - 1 oz peaty scotch
  - 0.5 oz maple syrup
  - 2 dashes Angostura bitters
  - 2 dashes Chocolate bitters
steps:
  - In a chilled rocks glass, combine bitters, maple syrup and spirits.
  - Stir gently with a large rock of ice for several turns
  - Garnish with an orange twist
notes:
  - I generally prefer using an overproofed whiskey when making old fashioned variations, and this is no exception. I had good results with Old Forester 1920.
  - I'm typically not a big fan of putting good scotch in cocktails, but something like the Laphroaig 10, or Ardbeg 10 works nicely. In a pinch, or when pinching pennies, I've used the Shieldaig Islay expression, which isn't great on its own, but imparts the desired base flavor profile.
  - This drink is meant to be built in the glass, and waters down well. The flavor profile shifts as the ice melts, and I find it relatively enjoyable throughout.
  - Using marginally less maple syrup might be desirable depending on how sweet you prefer the drink, but real maple syrup is key to bringing the rest of the flavors together.
