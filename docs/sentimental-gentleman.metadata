{"title":"Sentimental Gentleman","template":"recipe.mustache","time":"2 minutes","makes":"1 servings","ingredients":["2oz Scotch **(or Bourbon)**","0.5oz Benedictine","0.5oz Walnut Liquor"],"steps":["Add a large ice cube to a rocks glass","Pour in the scotch, benedictine, and walnut liquor","Stir till appropriately chilled"],"notes":["This is a great \"rusty nail\" variation, and the walnut flavor from the liquor complements a range of underlying whiskey notes, which makes it amenable to most brown spirits.","Different walnut liquors will likely affect the overall flavor of the drink, and Nux Alpina seems to be the one that bartenders like the best, but I couldn't find it around me, so settled for a Bulgarian one called Nero, which was all I could find.","I first tried this with Monkey Shoulder, which is the blended scotch that [Anders](https://www.youtube.com/@AndersErickson) uses in his video, and found it quite good. I later tried it with Johnnie Walker Double Black which I liked even better, and is probably my favorite rendition so far.","I tried using a few different bourbons **(of various proof intensities)**, but didn't find any that were as tasty in this cocktail as the blended scotch. Similarly, I tried a rum variant **(using Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva)**, which I enjoyed, but still was not as good as the blended scotch versions.","Rye whiskey is a mixed bag, with fruiter, lighter ryes working well, but spicy ones seeming to clash too much with the rest of the flavors in the drink.","Lastly, I tried with a few single malts, and the less peaty ones worked quite well. The best versions used richer **(older)** bodied scotch, but I couldn't bring myself to \"waste\" single malt like this, and so will likely stick to blended scotch in the future."],"basedon":["[Anders' Sentimental Gentleman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFjRjAP-k1k)","[Originally created by Misty Kalkofen at Brick and Mortar in Boston](http://www.robertsandjune.com/what-weve-been-drinking-sentimental-gentleman/)"],"CORK_url":"sentimental-gentleman.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0}
