{"title":"Lebanese Toum","template":"recipe.mustache","time":"5 minutes","makes":"Many servings","ingredients":["1 head of garlic","Lime","Salt","Neutral oil **(eg. Canola oil)**"],"steps":["Peel a whole head of garlic, removing the stem ends from the peeled cloves","In a wide mouth mason jar, add the garlic, a big pinch of salt, and the juice of 1 lime","Blitz the contents of the jar with a stick blender to break down the garlic","Slowly add the oil, a few fingers at a time, and mix till it emulsifies","Continue adding oil until the mason jar is full **(or to taste, depending on how diluted you want the garlic flavor to get)**","Finish with more salt or lime juice if needed"],"notes":["Most recipes I found use lemon, but I like the taste of lime juice in the toum better.","It is very important to only add a little oil at a time, or else the emulsion will break, and not come back together on its own. If that does happen, you can salvage it by adding an egg white to the mix. This will change the flavor of the toum, but will fix the emulsion, and still result in a delicious dip.","This toum works great as an alternative to mayo based sauces, and I've enjoyed with everything from chicken and beef skewers to fries.","Your breath, and potentially entire body, will smell like garlic after eating this."],"basedon":["[Serious Eats Traditional Toum](https://www.seriouseats.com/traditional-toum)"],"CORK_url":"lebanese-toum.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0,"content":"\n"}
