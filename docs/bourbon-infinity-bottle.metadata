This will alter the ratios of the constituent bourbon, but in traditional [Solera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solera) style, a fraction of each will remain","Over time the infinity bottle will begin to take on its own character, which you can guide by the inclusion of bourbons with specific flavor profiles"],"notes":["**2018-11-17** Tasted before adding the 1792, and it has a Bulliet backbone, but with notes of the Hudson Baby shining through. Most of the others are not noticeable, with maybe a hint of Old Forester","**2020-09-21** After quite some time away from bourbon, I have recently started drinking it as my nightcap, and as such have gone through a few new bottles. With the addition of the Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, the infinity bottle (750ml) is full. The Woodford comes through when I taste it, with some of the spice and heat of the Old Ezra, but it's getting pretty hard to tease out the constituent bourbons."],"basedon":["Lifelong bourbon exploration"],"CORK_url":"bourbon-infinity-bottle.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0}
