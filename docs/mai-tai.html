      <h2>notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li id="note">The overturned lime shell and mint sprig garnish is meant to look like a small tropical island and palm tree, and provides some welcome aromatics. Trader Vic, famed inventor of this cocktail, didn&#x27;t like the typical little umbrella garnish, and never used it.</li>
        <li id="note">Historically there is no rum &quot;float&quot;, but lots of people **(including me)** like it as a flavor enhancer. I&#x27;ll typically use a flavor packed rum like Diplomatico Reserva for it.</li>
        <li id="note">As with all cocktails, using fresh lime juice is essential</li>
        <li id="note">I&#x27;ve tried subbing in Rhum Agricole as the base spirit, but haven&#x27;t enjoyed the resulting drink as much as with regular dark rum.</li>
        <li id="note">I tend to over-shake **(and thus over-dilute)** cocktails, but with this one, I&#x27;ve found that I wasn&#x27;t diluting it enough, leading to it tasting too sharp initially, and then getting better as I let it sit and the ice melted. Unlike drinks that you shake&#x2F; stir and then strain, I think it is relatively difficult to over-dilute a cocktail like this which ends up getting served on the same ice it was mixed with.</li>
        <li id="note">While I gave exact measurements above, the important thing with all cocktails is the ratio, so in reality I usually juice a lime, and then adjust the rest of the proportions based on how much lime juice I&#x27;m working with.</li>
        <li id="note">There are a variety of Curacaos available, but by far the best one I&#x27;ve had so far is the Pierre Ferrand Dry Curacao, so I usually use that in my Mai Tais. In a pinch, Cointreau works as well.</li>
        <li id="note">My preferred simple syrup for a Mai Tai is to use 2 parts dark brown sugar to 1 part water. This is technically considered &quot;double strength&quot; simple syrup, and it adds a bit more viscosity **(and obviously a little more sweetness)** to the cocktail.</li>
      </ul>
