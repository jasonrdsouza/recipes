      <h2>notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The choice of gin impacts the final product by imparting a &quot;backbone&quot; to the cocktail of whatever flavor profile the gin embodies. For martinis, I tend to prefer a gin that isn&#x27;t overly herbal and piney, in order to not overwhelm the rest of the flavors. After testing a variety of gins, I settled on Bombay Sapphire for its balance of flavors, and reasonable price.</li>
        <li>The choice of dry vermouth makes or breaks the cocktail. If the Gin is the backbone, the Vermouth acts as the rest of the body. Personally I don&#x27;t like martinis made with the most common dry vermouths, because I find the vermouth flavors a bit flaccid. (Maybe this is why people have been putting less and less vermouth in their martinis over time...) Carpano, however, makes the excellent &quot;Carpano Bianco&quot; vermouth, which in my opinion makes a fantastic martini. This white vermouth is a litle sweeter than usual, but I think that acts to accentuate the flavors of the martini.</li>
        <li>I like a lot of olives in my martini... like, a light appetizers worth. To me the martini is the perfect aperitif, and the liquor soaked olives are a wonderful snack to prepare for dinner. I like to eat an olive with just about every sip, which means the standard 3 (of pitiful solo) olives are never enough.</li>
        <li>Given that I usually have a small jars worth of olives in the glass, there is no need for any olive juice, since the olive flavor is already nicely present. In fact, all the &quot;dirty&quot; martinis I&#x27;ve had have failed to impress, because the olive juice is a very poor substitute for actual olives, having a very one-note flavor</li>
        <li>The addition of a small amount of orange bitters may be confusing to someone already familiar with the normal martini template, but I find that it works quite well. There are typically two ways to take your martini... with olives, or with a twist. We&#x27;ve talked about the olive version above, but taking it &quot;with a twist&quot; means eschewing the olives in favor of an expressed lemon (or other citrus) peel. This results in a more refreshing, citrusy drink. Adding the drop of orange bitters lets me get the best of both worlds. It adds a hint of citrus, but I still get the briney olive flavors that I find pair so well with the gin and vermouth.</li>
        <li>The whole shaken vs stirred James Bond martini fiasco is an unnecessary distraction. Martinis are meant to have a silky, rich, and smooth mouthfeel, which you can only properly get by stirring them.</li>
        <li>Likewise, to ensure the proper mouthfeel and experience, it is crucial that the martini is *ice cold*. All cocktails change as they warm up, and martinis are no exception. This version in particular starts off crisp and refreshing (as if it was made with a twist), and gets a little saltier and more balanced as it warms up. Let it get too warm though, and the flavors get out of whack. To avoid that, it&#x27;s best to serve it immediately after making it, and drink it relatively quickly, or else make a batch (sans olives) and put it in the freezer (it won&#x27;t actually freeze because of the alcohol content). Then, you can portion it out directly from the freezer when ready.</li>
