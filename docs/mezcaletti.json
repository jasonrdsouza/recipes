Good 50/50 pairings are often surprising in their depth of flavor given the simple template, showcasing how thoughtful pairing of spirits can often be greater than the sum of their parts.","The Mezcaletti in particular has a delicious nutty, buttery, lusciousness which is quite surprising. The mezcal seems to \"stretch\" the Meletti out in a way that brings new flavor notes out in both. I particularly like it with Fidencio mezcal."],"basedon":["[Punch Drink 50/50 cocktails](https://punchdrink.com/articles/best-shots-amaro-whiskey-mezcal/)","[Punch Drink Mezcaletti](https://punchdrink.com/recipes/mezcaletti/)","[50/50 shot template](/assets/50_50_shot_template.jpeg)"],"CORK_url":"mezcaletti.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0,"content":"\n"}
