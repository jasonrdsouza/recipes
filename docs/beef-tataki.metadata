Unfortunately not all butchers sell this lesser known cut.","If you are just trying to sear the beef, I find it works well to do it directly over an open flame, since the additional heat will ensure a good crust on the outside without cooking the inside of the steak.","This recipe can also be made with tuna instead of beef. If using tuna, leave out the onion and garlic so as to not overwhelm the fish flavor.","It's easy enough to buy Ponzu sauce at most grocery stores, but you can also make it yourself relatively easily for a tastier alternative."],"basedon":["[Serious Eats - how to slice scallions](https://www.seriouseats.com/knife-skills-how-to-slice-scallions)","[Serious Eats Ponzu sauce](https://www.seriouseats.com/ponzu-sauce-recipe)","[Hiro's Beef Tataki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lxAfxBL_nQ)"],"CORK_url":"beef-tataki.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0}
