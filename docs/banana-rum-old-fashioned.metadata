I've tried and enjoyed it with an overproof rum and regular proof bourbon as well. The main requirement is that the whiskey and rum backbone have enough proof to stand up to the sweet, cooked banana flavors from the Creme de Banane.","Depending on whether you want funkier, fruiter notes or more vanilla/ caramel/ brown sugar flavors will determine whether you let the rum or bourbon take over. I do prefer it with a lighter **(funky)** rum, but have also enjoyed the template with [Plantation O.F.T.D.](https://www.plantationrum.com/oftd) and a mellower bourbon."],"basedon":["[Food & Wine Banana Rum Old Fashioned](https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/banana-rum-old-fashioned)","[Sam Ross' King Kong](https://cocktailvirgin.blogspot.com/2022/04/king-kong.html)"],"CORK_url":"banana-rum-old-fashioned.html","CORK_reading_time":1,"CORK_lix_readability_score":0,"CORK_ari_readability_score":0}
